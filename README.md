## Features ⌛

This project contains:
- A Visual Studio solution with Unit Testing.
- A class diagram of the solution.
- A sequence diagram of the solution.
- A detailed PDF explaning our aproach.

## Problem Statement

This is our "Design Pattern" course's final project. Through an implementation of the **Monopoly** in C#, the purpose of this project was to understand the importance and stakes of integrating Design Pattern in our code.

### Rules 📜

A set of Players is given, each with name and initial position. Dices are rolled and players’ positions on the Game Board will change. The game is played on a circular game board, composed of 40 positions on the board. Each player rolls two dices and moves forward by a number of positions equal to the sum of the numbers told by the two dice. The player can either meet a **GoToJail** square, a **VisitJail Square**, a **Luck Square** (move 5 foward), **Community Square** (move 3 backwards) or simply a **Normal Square**.

To go out of Jail, the player has to get both dices with the same value or fails to roll both dice with the same value for three times in a row.
